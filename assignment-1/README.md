## TODO:

- [ ] Ensure that you give predictions for all the test cases because some cases might be missed due to batching. Pad with some dummy cases to avoid this.

- [ ] Check if the labels are correct for the corresponding images.

- [x] Extend Denoising Autoencoder to Stacked Denoising Autoencoder.

- [x] Add shuffling step in CNN training.
